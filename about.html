    <h1> About Caley </h1>
    <p>I was born in a little village on the west coast of British Columbia called Bella Coola. I am of Cree heritage from central Alberta, and adopted member of the Nuxalk Nation of Bella Coola. </p>
    <p>I attended art school at Emily Carr University of Art and Design and earned a Bachelor of Fine Art.  Here, I learned a little bit of everything including drawing, painting, and film. </p>
    <p> After graduation, I moved back home to Bella Coola and built a cabin on my parents land. At home, I paint, make music and garden. I live with my partner Justin, dog Banjo, and cat Minnow.</p>
